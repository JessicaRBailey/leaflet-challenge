Challenge 15

This html, css, and javascript code generates a map with earthquakes from that last 7 days that are at least 1.0 in magnitude.  

The map starts zoomed in on the United States, but can be zoomed out by the user to see all recent earthquakes around the world. 

The color of the circle that represents each earthquake represents how deep the quake was.  The legend shows green/yellow quakes are shallow and orange/red quakes are deep.

The size of the circle represents the magnitude of the quake with larger circles corresponding to greater magnitude quakes. 

Finally, you can click on any circle representing and earthquake and see its location, magnitude, and depth.
